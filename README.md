# ES6
# Prevent Object Mutation
As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.
```
function freezeObj() {
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
  // Only change code below this line
Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

  // Only change code above this line
  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch(ex) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();

```
# Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFunc = () => "value";
This code will still return the string value by default.

Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.
```
const magic = () => new Date;
```
# Write Arrow Functions with Parameters
Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function.

const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);
doubler(4) would return the value 8.

If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.

const doubler = item => item * 2;
It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.

const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
multiplier(4, 2) would return the value 8.

Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.
```
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => {
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
};

console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
```
